    "\n",
    "This module focuses on generating numerical solutions of **hyperbolic** partial differential equations (PDEs).  Recall that these types of second-order PDEs\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Au_{xx}+2Bu_{xy}+Cu_{yy}+Du_{x}+Eu_{y}+Fu+G=0 \\tag{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "are defined by the condition $B^2-AC > 0$ (where $y$ is considered the $t$ variable and thus $A=1$, $C=-\\frac{1}{c}$ and all others are equal 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Three interesting examples (with increasing complexity) are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Acoustic wave equation (Homogeneous medium)**: The acoustic wave equation (AWE) is normally used to model the pressure disturbance $\\phi=\\phi(x,y,z,t)$ generated by an acoustic wave propagation through a fluid medium defined by constant velocity $v=\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{\\rho}}$ where $K$ is the bulk compressibility and $\\rho$ is the density.\n",

    "\n",
    "where $F(x,y,z,t)$ is an external force term.  Note that the acoustic wave equation is commonly used in exploration seismology to approximate compressional (i.e., P-wave) propagation through complex heterogeneous media.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   * **Acoustic wave equation (variable density)**: This is like the example above, except now that the density, $\\rho$, is assumed to spatially vary:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial t^2}  -  K \\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\nabla \\phi  \\right) = F(x,y,z,t), \\tag{3}$$ \n",
    "   \n",
    "where $K$ is the bulk compressability.  This equation is commonly used in computational ocean acoustics because it allows one to introduce variations in density caused by temperature and salinity concentration among others.  This wave equation requires the same type of initial and boundary conditions as the homogenous equation above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **One-way wave equations**:  We have actually looked at this hyperbolic equation in Module 7 of the course. One can recognize this to be the case if we **factorize** the 1D AWE given above in the following way\n",

    "Here we see that we have the produce of the left- and right-going advection equations. This was recognized in 1747 by French scientist [d'Alembert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Alembert%27s_formula).  Note that one sometimes see the **d'Alembert operator** $\\Box^2$ in various problems in mathematical physics, which is given by the following in Cartesian coordinates:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Initial and Boundary Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is a **second-order** temporal partial derivative, uniquely defining a wavefield solution requires implementing **two initial conditions** that define the wavefield at, say, time zero: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi(x,y,z,t=0)=f(x,y,z) \\tag{6}$$ \n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t}(x,y,z,t=0) = g(x,y,z).\\tag{7}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One also has to prescribe the behavior of the wavefield solution on the domain boundary $D$ (e.g., $\\left. \\phi\\right|_{\\partial D}=B(x,y,z)$). In some circumstances, one may want to apply a Dirchelet BC\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\phi(\\mathbf {x}) = f(\\mathbf {x}), \\quad \\forall \\mathbf {x}\\in \\delta \\Omega \\tag{8}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where one sets $f(x)=0$ to obtain an inward moving reflected wave with the oppositing polarity. This is commonly used for waves approaching the free surface of a fluid acoustic medium.  However, in most other circumstances one wants to have perfectly absorbing boundary conditions such that no energy is reflected back into the finite-sized computational domain. These are the so-called (Sommerville) radiation boundary conditions which require the wave disturbance to vanish at infinity in an unbounded medium.  This topic, though, remains an active area of research and goes well beyond the scope of this course."

    "# 1D Acoustic wave equation\n",

Because of the easy connection with everyday experience, let's assume examine the propagation of a wave on a homogeneous taut string of length $L$ where both of the string ends and fixed. In this case, we can assume that there is no external forcing function (i.e., $F(x,t)=0$) and the string starts from some combination of an initial displacement disturbance $\\phi(x,t=0) = f(x)$ and an initial velocity $\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t}(x,t=0) = g(x)$. Thus, the PDE we are solving is\n",

Let's start by using a standard **centered in time centered in space** (CTCS) $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^2,\\Delta t^2)$ discretization:\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's now multiply through by $\\Delta t^2$ and use the square of the Courant number $C^2 = \\frac{v^2\\Delta t^2}{\\Delta x^2}$ from the previous modules to write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi^{n+1}_i - 2\\phi^{n}_i +\\phi^{n-1}_i = C^2 \\left( \\phi^{n}_{i+i} - 2\\phi^{n}_i +\\phi^{n}_{i-1}\\right). \\tag{11}$$\n",

    "### Initial Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Above we noted that two initial conditions are required for this PDE because of the second temporal derivative. However, based on the above discretization it may not be apparent how the derivative initial condition can be introduced.  One thing to note is that the discretization now contains term $\\phi^{n-1}_i$, which represents the wavefield at the previous time step. Thus, this can be used to set the second condition by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} \\approx \\frac{\\phi^n_i - \\phi^{n-1}_i}{\\Delta t} = g(x).  \\tag{13}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The common assumption is that the wavefield is **quiescent** (i.e., no energy) at time steps $n=0$ and $n=-1$. This means that $g(x)=0$ in equation 13 and thus $\\phi^0_i=\\phi^{-1}_i=0$.  However, in cases where we have $g(x)\\neq 0$ then we can use a  finite-difference approximation to specify the wavefield at the previous time step as\n",

    "\n",
    "### Handling Boundaries with Ghost Points\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also explore what happens at the left and right boundaries from equation 12.  At the left hand boundary (i.e., $i=0$) we can write\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi^{n+1}_1 = 2\\phi^{n}_1 -\\phi^{n-1}_1 +C^2 \\left(\\phi^{n}_{2} -2 \\phi^{n}_1 + \\phi^{n}_{0}\\right). \\tag{14}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is a $ \\phi^{n}_{0}$ term in this equation.  Currently, we are able to handle this because we can use the Dirchelet boundary condition to set this point equal to zero.  However, if we were to use higher-order finite-difference stencils for our second derivative, these would require using additional points such as $\\phi^n_{-1}$ which represent a point falling out of the grid! Let's assume that we can set $ \\phi^{n}_{-1}=0$ (as well those with an increasing negative index).  This is termed using **ghost points** which are not formally defined, but are conjured up for numerical expediency.  Similarly, on the right-hand side we will have to do the same at ghost point $ \\phi^{n}_{N+1}=0$ as well as those with greater indices.\n",

One strategy would be to use a smaller $\\Delta x$, which is easy to do in a 1D solution because the computational cost scales according to $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ where $N$ is the number of points. However, in 3D this approach would scale according to $\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ since we would have to apply it in each dimension!  This would significantly affect our computational efficiency. \n",

To do this, let's rewrite the 1D solver for homogeneous media from above to incorporate an $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^8)$ centered approximation of the second-order spatial partial derivative.

This is because velocity models usually are heterogeneous: $v=v(x,y)$. Thus, we need to account for this spatial heterogeneity in our numerical solvers.

    "One of the most important features of the acoustic wave equation (and hyperbolic PDEs in general) is that one can time reverse the wave propagation (but it gets complicated at the boundary) from maximum time back to zero time.  This is due to the analytical PDE operator being [self-adjoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-adjoint_operator). (In principle, this does not mean that the numerical implementation is necessarily self-adjoint; one needs to ensure that this is so by applying a [dot-product test](http://sepwww.stanford.edu/sep/prof/bei/conj/paper_html/node11.html)).\n",
